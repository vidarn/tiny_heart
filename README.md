# Tiny heart
Mimmi is a litte creature  that has lost her friend. Being so small, mimmi's heart beats very fast and she needs to eat often to survive. Help her find her friend, but make sure she does not run out of nutrients before getting there.

Tiny heart is a puzzle game where you must find the best route through the levels without mimmi running out of any of the nutrients that she needs. There are three types of nutrients and eating different flowers will replenish their supply. The icons at the top of the screen represent the nutrients and running out of either one will make mimmi faint.

Use the **arrow keys** (or wasd, zqsd or hjkl) to move. Press **r** to restart a level.
